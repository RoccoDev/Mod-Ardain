## Create Blade: Disable Save
Disables auto-save when resonating with Blades. This in turn speeds up the animation.

## Return to Title Combo
Adds a button combo to return to the title screen, without having to close and re-open the game.  
Buttons: L + R + A + Plus

## Infinite Flutterheart Grass
Allows you to hold 99x Flutterheart Grass, and respawns it every time it is collected, without having to remove it from your inventory.

## Fix Chain Attack Damage Rate
Fixes chain attack base damage resetting to 100% when "Enemy Attack Power" is > 100% (e.g. in Bringer of Chaos) and you cancel an attack.
